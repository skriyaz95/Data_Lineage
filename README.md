# Data_Lineage

Guys till now we have done the parser phase of the project. The two folders columnImpact and dlineage are the sql parsers.
ColumnImpact extracts data from sql query and puts it in a table.
dlineage extracts data and converts it into an xml reresentation.

Steps to execute:
1.In columnImpact folder compile the columnImpact.java file putting the two jar files provided in the classpath.
2.To execute it type the class name followed by the arguments which u can give by looking into the program.
3.The same goes with the dlineage and in there execute the DLineageRelation program.

i have also put in the input query and xml output.
Now we are left with visualing the data we have extracted out of sql query...:)
